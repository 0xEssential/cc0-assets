# CC0 Assets

Many NFT projects are embracing the Creative Commons CC0 license for their artworks.

These projects recognize the positive sum outcomes created by allowing anyone to freely use their IP. As William M. Peaster writes, 

> Being in the public domain is the most salient advantage of CC0 NFT projects. ...The CC0 status fosters an environment in which an open community develops IP together, and all derivatives/spinoffs/remixes extend the original projectâ€™s aura and cultural charge. Accordingly, CC0 can be a powerful force multiplier for growing an NFT brand.

This repository exists to help these projects offer their assets and IP to those who may want to use it in their own projects. If CC0 assets are difficult to find and use then those assets are not _in the public domain_.

The community is welcome to submit Pull Requests to add CCO assets, organized by project.
